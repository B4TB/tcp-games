# TCP Games Hackathon

I'm not allowed to "advertise" this "event" on non-Reed channels, so
this README will contain *no information whatsoever* about this
event. It will, however, describe this repository:

All the code that we write (at an undisclosed location at an
undisclosed time; Reed students please contact atali@reed.edu for
details) will be pushed here. Later, when we get our server, we'll set
up our games to run constantly on the Reed LAN.

These games can be literally anything; see the examples directory for
some ideas. These should be cute little text-based games that we can
connect to and play via [netcat](https://netcat.sourceforge.net/). Some things you can do:

+ Make simple games.
+ Make multiplayer games.
+ Make fun games.
+ Make deeply unfun games. (Like Tristan!)
+ Write in the world's worst programming language.
+ Use io_uring.
+ Use synchronous socket io from C.
+ Cause problems.
+ Write the best code of your life.
+ Crash your laptop.
+ Crash other people's laptops.
+ ...and so forth.
